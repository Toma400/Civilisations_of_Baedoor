/**
 * HERE THERE WILL BE INFORMATION ON WHAT YOU NEED TO KEEP IN MIND WHILE WORKING ON FEATURES (reminder for me + info for people using remote workspace)
 * 
 * A lot of elements in CoB is yet placeholders, so if you do not understand why this thing exist - maybe it is because it should not. I'm testing things due to early stage of CoB development.
 * This may result on me getting more knowledgeable about generation specifics, so I can make mod better in further development. Do not worry about that.
 * 
 * 
 * [ENTITY ADDING]
 * 
 * 1. Try using ambient type + conditions, not monster/creature type. CoB will try to make mobcaps configurable, and ambient is easiest way to do that.
 * 
 * 2. Use custom spawning conditions (desert_mob_conditioning is general for all Dune-related animals, for example)
 *  
 * 3. Include mobs in mobcap lists, like Tag desert_animals_mobcap (for animals).
